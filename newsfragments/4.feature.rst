Added glue to support ``pytest-trio``.

Added `Frame.hide_line` and `Context.hide` attributes for more precise
control of output.

Added :func:`unwrap_context_generator` hook for more specific customization
of generator-based context managers.

Modified the :func:`elaborate_frame` hook to be able to return a sequence
of stack items rather than just a single one. This permits more expressive
augmentation rules, such as inserting elements into the stack trace without
removing what would've been there if the hook were not present.

:func:`elaborate_frame` now runs after `Frame.contexts` is populated,
so it has the chance to modify the detected context managers.
