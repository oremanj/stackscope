stackscope can now trace seamlessly across Trio/thread boundaries when
extracting a stack that includes calls to :func:`trio.to_thread.run_sync`
and/or :func:`trio.from_thread.run`. The functions running in the
cross-thread child will appear in the same way that they would if they
had been called directly without a thread transition.
